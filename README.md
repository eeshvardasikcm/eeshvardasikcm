## About Me

I am a dedicated lifelong learner with nearly two decades of study in **Ayurveda** and the practice of **Krishna Bhakti Yoga**. This profound spiritual journey has provided me with unique perspectives on discipline, holistic systems, and well-being, which I now integrate into my approach to software development and project management. After a period dedicated to these spiritual explorations, I am now channeling this experience, alongside focused technical training, to develop innovative solutions. I learn effectively by creating new code and am committed to making steady progress on my personal brand and my professional career.

## üí° Exploring GitHub

I see GitHub as a valuable platform for showcasing skills and collaborating. While many of my current projects are developed privately, I am exploring opportunities to release code and contribute more actively to the open-source community as my projects mature.
_Serious issues with GitHub not propogating links in profile bio has caused me to start a process of not using links in GitHub bio any longer. I suppose I could just put the links in a profile repository because the vcs system in the GitHub UI appears to propogate somewhat betted than other parts of the GitHub site._
