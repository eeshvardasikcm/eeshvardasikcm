I am the sole designer, developer, and creator of projects like **Ayurveda Project Management** and my new project, **[APM Essence Grove](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/Essence-Groove)**. My passion lies in bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology. I am also currently developing my **Insight for Good Platform**.

SOME REPOSITORIES ARE NOW PRIVATE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PUBLIC. I HOPE TO NOT MAKE PRIVATE ANY REPOSITORY OF MINE THAT IS FORKED FROM BY OTHERS. Please make issues and pull requests and talk with me explaining, and your fork should be okay. _I like this [policies](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) template. Discrimination against people for having a background in or current experience or role in any one particular field, computing language, expertise, or lack of discreet expertise, are additional forms of unwanted behavior. Please feel open to share ideas and ask questions in my repositories or with me. Efforts to communicate in general should not be seen as an annoyance. Use good ethics. AI is in new territory. I have been talking about human behavior. Licensing concerns with AI is a new concern in this field. I am not an attourney and I do not give legal advice. My repositories are actively accepting Apache 2.0 licensing. Adherence to Apache 2.0 licensing is a primary aim in my repositories. I would generally say that use of technology as an extension of unethical human behavior is not a good thing. Please try to use appologies and empathy, and try not to stonewall or ban people. Personal safety and privacy is important. If you don't feel safe or ic you feel uncomfortable, please refer to  this [policies](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) template and this [rust conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). I have not officailly adopted the rust conduct here. I just think it might help to read these if you don't feel safe or comfortable. Try not to blame others and try to use empathy. A good technique is to see a problem domain as inclusive. Be cautious about excluding people simply because it appears like the error or problem may have originated from them (or their interactions) or if they seek further clarity._

## About Me

I am a dedicated lifelong learner with nearly two decades of study in **Ayurveda** and the practice of **Krishna Bhakti Yoga**. This profound spiritual journey has provided me with unique perspectives on discipline, holistic systems, and well-being, which I now integrate into my approach to software development and project management. After a period dedicated to these spiritual explorations, I am now channeling this experience, alongside focused technical training, to develop innovative solutions. I learn effectively by creating new code and am committed to making steady progress on my personal brand and my professional career.

## üí° Exploring GitHub

I see GitHub as a valuable platform for showcasing skills and collaborating. While many of my current projects are developed privately, I am exploring opportunities to release code and contribute more actively to the open-source community as my projects mature.
_Serious issues with GitHub not propogating links in profile bio has caused me to start a process of not using links in GitHub bio any longer. I suppose I could just put the links in a profile repository because the vcs system in the GitHub UI appears to propogate somewhat betted than other parts of the GitHub site._
