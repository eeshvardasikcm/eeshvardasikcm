I am the sole designer, developer, and creator of projects like **Ayurveda Project Management** and my new project, **[APM Essence Grove](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/Essence-Groove)**. My passion lies in bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology. I am also currently developing my **Insight for Good Platform**.

SOME REPOSITORIES ARE NOW PRIVATE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PUBLIC. I HAVE NEVER MADE PRIVATE ANY REPOSITORY OF MINE THAT IS FORKED FROM BY OTHERS. I like this [policies](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) template. I see discrimination against people for having a background in or current experience or role in any one particular field, computing language, expertise, or lack of discreet expertise, as additional forms of unwanted behavior. Please feel open to share ideas and ask questions in my repositories or with me in repositories of others (as long as you follow their rules also). Efforts to communicate in general should not be seen as an annoyance. Use good ethics. AI is in new territory. I have been talking about human behavior. Licensing concerns with AI is a new concern in this field. I am not an attourney and I do not give legal advice. I would generally say that use of technology as an extension of unethical human behavior is not a good thing. Please try to use appologies and empathy, and try not to stoneeall or ban people. Personal safety and privacy is most important. If you don't feel safe or comfortable, please refer to  this [policies](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md) template.

## Ayurveda Project Management

![1000001348](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c607e5f-455d-4413-a5dd-ba27ea89e9c2)

I am the sole designer, developer, and creator of this upcoming application for Android and Web.

* **Current Status**: This project is currently in active development.
* **Platform**: The application is being developed for Android and the Web.
* **Future Plans**: I plan to share more about the development journey on GitHub as the project progresses.
* **Official Website**: [AyurvedaProjectManagement.com](https://ayurvedaprojectmanagement.com/)

## About Me

I am a dedicated lifelong learner with nearly two decades of study in **Ayurveda** and the practice of **Krishna Bhakti Yoga**. This profound spiritual journey has provided me with unique perspectives on discipline, holistic systems, and well-being, which I now integrate into my approach to software development and project management. After a period dedicated to these spiritual explorations, I am now channeling this experience, alongside focused technical training, to develop innovative solutions. I learn effectively by creating new code and am committed to making steady progress on my personal brand and my professional career.

## üî≠ I‚Äôm Currently Working On

* **Ayurveda Project Management App:** The development of this platform for Android and Web is largely on hold until the conclusion of the Agent Development Kit Hackathon. I plan to share more about its development journey and potentially some code flows here on GitHub once I resume active development.
* [My new designs](https://github.com/eeshvardasikcm/cpp-how-to/blob/main/precision-performance.md). The experience working directly with Fearless SIMD was very helpful, as their approach appears to be beyond my introductory precision-performance processing here. I am happy that I chose to seek clarity with Fearless SIMD as early as possible upon beginning my research.
  * The clarity provided increased my understanding considerably. My DevOps perspective is not interested in entering into discrete scenarios concerning precision-performance processing. The training I have received in DevOps addresses a different level of the cost management. I have chosen some safe math libraries for my precision needs, and prefer to avoid iterating development processes at such a low level.
  * Linear algebra has many new applications in modern times. It's been fun doing this research, and I am looking forward to building my MLOps solution privately. Mathematics is at the heart of many branches of computing technologies, and in this modern era can be utilized beyond the processor in many ways. Exception handling is an important part of the continous integration and continuous development process.
* **Machine Learning Engineering:** Deepening my expertise through Google Cloud Skills Boosts, focusing on the Machine Learning Engineering Certification coursework.

## üí° Exploring GitHub

I see GitHub as a valuable platform for showcasing skills and collaborating. While many of my current projects are developed privately, I am exploring opportunities to release code and contribute more actively to the open-source community as my projects mature.
_Serious issues with GitHub not propogating links in profile bio has caused me to start a process of not using links in GitHub bio any longer. I suppose I could just put the links in a profile repository because the vcs system in the GitHub UI appears to propogate somewhat betted than other parts of the GitHub site._
